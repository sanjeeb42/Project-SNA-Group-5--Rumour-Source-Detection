# Rumour Source Detection - Social Network Analysis


This project is Done under the Department of Computer Science and Engineereing, NIT Silchar.<br>

Description: Rumour Source Detection<br>

Aim :-To identifying the source of rumour in a large-scale social network where internode relationship strengths are random.<br>

Algorithm:-<br>
<br>
It proposes a Two-stage algorithm to locate the source of rumour.<br>
The algorithm uses the social network's modularity to find the rumourâ€™s source<br>
with fewer sensor nodes compared to other algorithms. <br>

      1.The first stage identifying the most probable cluster 
         containing the rumor source.

     2.The second stage estimating the source from nodes in the identified cluster .<br>


Experimental evaluations with data shows that the Two stage algorithm outperforms the other available algorithms in terms of - 
       1.Accuracy of localizing the source.

       2.It can determine the actual source within two hops 69-80% of time.
